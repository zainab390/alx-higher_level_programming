Technical interview preparation:

You are not allowed to google anything
Whiteboard first
Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

Prototype: int is_palindrome(listint_t **head);
Return: 0 if it is not a palindrome, 1 if it is a palindrome
An empty list is considered a palindrom
